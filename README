Xpriori-XMS version 0.02
========================

Perl extension for XprioriXMS/NeoCoreXMS Database.

You should configure your XpriroiXMS/NeoCoreXMS,
before using this distribution.
Because I can't find out a good way to set your database 
for testing distribution tests, this distribution has 
only 1 test. Instead of test codes, you can use samples/*.pl 
for your tests.
